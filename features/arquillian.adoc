Arquillian Eclipse is a JBoss Tools component that makes it simple to create and maintain Arquillian tests.
It provides the ability to add Arquillian artifacts to a project as well as create, validate and run Arquillian JUnit tests.

Arquillian Eclipse helps you create Arquillian JUnit tests and generate a deployment method.

There is also the *Run As/Debug As>Arquillian JUnit Test* action that checks if the Arquillian test environment is valid.

== Arquillian validator 
=== Validate the Arquillian environment

The Arquillian validator finds the following issues:

* classes that are used in a test, but aren't included in the deployment
* tests without a deployment method and/or a test method
* resources that can't be found 
* invalid archive name

The most of the issues have an Eclipse quick fix.
